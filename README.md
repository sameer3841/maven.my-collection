# My Collection

## Overview

This project is a deep dive into the inner workings of the Java `Collection` framework. Instead of relying on built-in collection classes, I implemented my own versions of these structures from scratch. The goal was to enhance my understanding of data structures, algorithmic efficiency, and object-oriented design in Java.

### Why I Built This

I wanted to gain hands-on experience with the core principles behind collections like lists, sets, and maps. By re-implementing these structures, I deepened my understanding of how they work under the hood, including their performance characteristics and memory management.

## Features

- Custom implementations of various collection classes
- No usage of built-in Java collection classes
- Focus on performance and scalability
- JUnit tests to validate correctness

## Getting Started

To try out this project, follow these steps:

### Cloning the Repository

1. Navigate to a directory where you want to store the project.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MYUSERNAME/NAMEOFPROJECT.git
   ```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd NAMEOFPROJECT
   ```
4. Open the project in your preferred IDE and ensure that the test cases execute properly.

## Running Tests

To verify that the implementations work correctly, run the JUnit test cases included in the project. The tests will indicate how well each collection performs.
